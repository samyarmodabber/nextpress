I am excited to announce a new addition to our codebase: the Carousel component. This component is designed to seamlessly integrate into your application, providing a dynamic and visually appealing way to showcase a series of slides. Below, we'll walk through the key features and how to use of this new component.

## Key Features:

1. **Automatic Sliding**: The Carousel component automatically transitions between slides at a specified interval, enhancing user engagement.
2. **Manual Navigation**: Users can manually navigate through the slides using previous and next buttons.
3. **Responsive Design**: The component is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across all device sizes.
4. **Customizable**: You can easily customize the content of each slide, including images, titles, descriptions, and links.

## How to Use the Carousel Component:

### Import the Component:

```jsx:YourComponent.jsx
import Carousel from '@/components/Carousel'
```

### Provide Slides Data:

Create an array of slide objects with **id**, **src**, **alt**, **link_src**, **title**, and **description** properties.

```ts:data/carousel/demo.ts

export const slides = [
  {
    id: 1,
    src: '/static/images/carousel/380-1920x700.jpg',
    title: 'Blog',
    description: 'Visit our posts on my Blog ',
    alt: 'blog',
    link_src: '/blog',
    link_text: 'Blog',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    src: '/static/images/carousel/443-1920x700.jpg',
    title: 'Projects',
    description: 'See list of projects!',
    alt: 'projects',
    link_src: '/projects',
    link_text: 'Projects',
  }]

```

### Include the Component in Your Page:

Pass **slides** object and **interval** to the component.

```jsx:YourComponent.jsx

<Carousel slides={slides} interval={3000} />

```

The Carousel component is now ready to be integrated into your Next.js project, providing a sleek and interactive element to display your content. Feel free to customize the styling and behavior to match your applicationâ€™s needs. Happy coding!
