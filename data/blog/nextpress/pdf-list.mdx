## How to Embed List of PDF

In this tutorial, we'll introduce `PDFList` component that you can create a **dynamic PDF gallery** in your NextPress app. Each PDF will have a clickable image thumbnail. If a thumbnail is missing, we’ll show a default image instead.

This is perfect for displaying documents, papers, or reports in a visually appealing way.

### Folder Structure

Make sure your files are organized like this:

```bash
public/
    static/
    pdf/
    default.jpg
        python/
            learn-python-basic.pdf
            learn-python-basic.jpg
            advanced-python.pdf ← no thumbnail → uses default
        math/
            calculusI.pdf
            calculusI.png
            calculusII.pdf
            calculusII.png
```

- Each PDF has an optional `.jpg` or `.png` image with the same filename.
- A `default.jpg` is used if a preview image is missing.

### How to use it

```js
<PDFList setName="python" />
```

### The Result is as follow

<PDFList setName="python" />
