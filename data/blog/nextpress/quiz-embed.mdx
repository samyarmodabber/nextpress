## Features & Usage

### Features

Here’s a list of **all features** currently included in your `Quiz` component, along with a **brief explanation** of each:

| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Start Quiz Screen**        | Displays a welcome screen with a “Start Quiz” button before questions begin.     |
| **2. Per-Question Timer**       | Each question has a countdown (default: 10 seconds). Time runs out = skip.       |
| **3. Auto Advance (Optional)**  | If `autoAdvance=true`, next question shows automatically after answering.        |
| **4. Manual Advance Support**   | If `autoAdvance=false`, user must press "Next" or use **Space** key.             |
| **5. Keyboard Shortcuts**       | Select options using keys `1`–`4`, press **Space** to go to next (manual mode).  |
| **6. Answer Highlighting**      | Answers turn green (correct) or red (wrong) after selection.                     |
| **7. Question Breakdown**       | At the end, a detailed result with correct/your answers is shown.                |
| **8. Restart Quiz**             | "Restart Quiz" button resets everything and brings you back to the Start page.   |
| **9. Responsive Layout**        | Works well on both mobile and desktop (grid adapts automatically).               |
| **10. Visual Option Labels**    | Each option has a small badge (1–4) at the top-right to help keyboard users.     |
| **11. Dark Mode Support**       | Automatically adapts to light/dark themes with Tailwind’s `dark:` classes.       |
| **12. Skipped/Timeout Answers** | If time runs out, the answer is marked as incorrect and recorded as "No Answer". |
| **13. Accessible Markup**       | Buttons are semantic and keyboard navigable (for accessibility).                 |
| **14. Configurable Props**      | Customize with:                                                                  |

### How to Use

1. **Provide Quiz Data**

```ts
const quizData = [
  {
    question: 'What is 2 + 2?',
    answers: ['3', '4', '5', '6'],
    correctIndex: 1,
  },
  // ... more questions
]
```

2. **Render Component**

```tsx
<Quiz quizData={quizData} autoAdvance={false} timePerQuestion={10} />
```

3. **Styling Support**

Ensure you have Tailwind CSS configured and `darkMode: 'class'` in `tailwind.config.js`.

4. **Theme Switching**

Support dark mode by toggling a `dark` class on `<html>` or `<body>` element (e.g., via `next-themes`).
