## How to Embed YouTube Videos

Embedding YouTube videos in your Next.js app can greatly enhance your content by providing rich media experiences.
The most common method is to use an `<iframe>` with the YouTube embed URL, but sometimes you might run into issues where the video is blocked or doesnâ€™t load properly.

You can embed youtube as follow:

```tsx
<YouTube videoId="8-VAnXzkXOc">
```

<YouTube videoId="8-VAnXzkXOc" />
